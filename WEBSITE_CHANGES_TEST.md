# Website Display Changes Test

## Changes Made:

### 1. Conditional Rendering
- **BEFORE**: Website field was always rendered, even when empty
- **AFTER**: Website field is only rendered if:
  - User is in editing mode (`isEditing = true`), OR
  - Website value exists and is not empty (`profile.website?.trim()`)

### 2. Dynamic Grid Layout
- **BEFORE**: Fixed 3-column grid layout
- **AFTER**: Dynamic grid layout based on available fields:
  - 2 fields (email + location): `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2`
  - 3 fields with long email: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-[1.5fr_1fr_1fr]`
  - 3 fields with normal email: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3`

### 3. Website URL Truncation
- **BEFORE**: Truncated after 30 characters with CSS ellipsis only
- **AFTER**: Truncated after 20 characters with:
  - Manual truncation: `website.substring(0, 20)...`
  - CSS ellipsis as fallback
  - Tooltip showing full URL on hover
  - Better visual indication for long URLs

## Test Cases:

1. **No Website Entered**: Website field should not appear at all
2. **Short Website**: `example.com` - should display fully
3. **Long Website**: `e-info.me/@123456789086` - should display as `e-info.me/@12345678...`
4. **Editing Mode**: Website field should always appear (for input)
5. **Grid Layout**: Should automatically adjust from 3-column to 2-column when website is hidden

## Files Modified:
- `/frontend/src/components/UnifiedDigitalCard.tsx`

The changes ensure a cleaner UI when no website is provided and better handling of long URLs with proper truncation and tooltips.
